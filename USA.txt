Improving access to content and experts
Pre-service eLearning programmes have been evaluated
Lack of evidence that eLearning is effective
Not possible to gain a health sciences degree entirely through eLearning
Lack of evidence showing cost-effectiveness or EHR
Lack of infrastructure
which governs the sharing of digital data between health professionals in other health services in the same country through the use of an EHR
Country has national policy or strategy on the use of social media by government organizations
Effective standards and best practices for data capture not fully established
Lack of integration between various health services
Privacy and security laws need to be in place

Demand
Capacity

eLearning used for in-service training of health professionals
Lack of demand for eLearning programmes
eLearning courses accredited by continuing medical education or professional licensing bodies
Reducing cost of delivering content
Enabling access to education where learning facilities are limited
National strategy does not promote the adoption of EHR
Lack of capacity
Lack of national or international standards for interoperability of EHR

which allows individuals to demand that their own data be corrected  when held in an EHR if it is known to be inaccurate
Policy or strategy makes specific reference tothe use of social media in the health domain
to define medical jurisdiction, liability or reimbursement of eHealth services such as telehealth
which allows individuals to demand the deletion of health-related data from their EHR
